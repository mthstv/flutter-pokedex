# Flutter PokÃ©dex

This is a WIP [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) PokÃ©dex app using the free API [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

To run this app, simply run `flutter run` on your terminal. You'll need an Android or IPhone emulator running.

This is an ongoing project of mine for learning flutter, suggestions on the code are much appreciated! 
I'll also try do document my progress in this repository, so check regularly for updates!

I'm learning flutter right now for my postgraduate course [Mobile & Multi-platform Application Projects at Descomplica](https://descomplica.com.br/pos-graduacao/tecnologia/pos-em-projetos-de-aplicativos-moveis-multiplataforma/) ðŸ’š
